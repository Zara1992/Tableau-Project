# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
“TB” is short for a disease called tuberculosis. TB is spread through the air from one person to another. TB germs are passed through the air when someone who is sick with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks, laughs, sings, or sneezes. 
TB is a global concern due to the increasing number of people infected. The pattern of increase is greatest in areas of the world with high HIV. 
**Explore how TB/HIV+ as a disease has evolved around the world and has there been any impact from global efforts to lower it’s spread. **

## Process
1. Connected data to data source (single excel file)
2. Inspected data and adjusted data type (Geographical, date)
3. Explore the data
    * Cases with TB only
    * Cases with TB and HIV both
4. Identified important features
* Population Number
* Case Detection Rate
* Case Prevalence Rate
* Death Rate
5. Develop questions based on important features
6. Create Worksheets, dashboards and story to deliver findings



## Results
Option 2
Tuberculosis Burden by Country

Q1 – How has TB disease prevailed over the years? 
Q2 – How successful have been the global policies to curb TB?
Q3 – Has there been any improvements in the diagnostics of TB disease? 
Q4 – Understand the distribution of death count in patients across the countries.
Q5 – Understand the distribution of mortality per 100,000 population across the regions.


## Challenges 
* It would be ideal to have some sort of information on what the data represents (definition of each column)
* I felt that there should have been a distinction between mortality and death columns in the data source. What is the difference between the 2 columns and the data within it. 
* The regions should have been identified in complete form like Africa instead of a code AFR.
* The source of the data should be linked for better analysis. 



## Future Goals
If there was more time I would add other data sources like economic indicators (Income, GDP) and Health statistics of the countries to future analyse the data.
